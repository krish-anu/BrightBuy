## Frontend

Frontend is built with `React` and `TypeScript`. UI components are made using `ShadCN` and `Tailwind CSS`.

### Run Frontend

To run the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and use the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

### Push your changes to Git

**Do not push directly to `main` (main isn't protected).**

Follow these steps to contribute:

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
2. Make your changes and stage them:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Describe your changes"
    ```
3. Before pushing, pull the latest changes from `main`:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
4. Push your branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
5. Go to GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to `main`.

Replace `your-branch-name` with the name of your branch.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
